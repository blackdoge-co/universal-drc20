# The Dogecoin Universal Protocol & Doge Indexer
*The best protocol is the one we build together—block by block, with the strength of the Doge.*

## Introduction

Following the revolutionary success of BRC-20 on Bitcoin, the Dogecoin ecosystem now welcomes its own evolution: **The DRC-20 Universal Protocol**. Born from the same principles that made BRC-20 a grassroots phenomenon, DRC-20 brings fungible tokens to Dogecoin with radical simplicity and community-first design.

The DRC-20 Universal Protocol preserves the elegance of the original concept while addressing its limitations. By leveraging Dogecoin's native **OP_RETURN** outputs instead of complex witness data, we create a lean, efficient, and truly decentralized token ecosystem that honors both Satoshi's vision and the Doge community's spirit.

**Key Innovations:**
- **OP_RETURN Based**: Clean, prunable, network-friendly design
- **Account-Based Model**: Safe, intuitive token management tied to addresses
- **Multi-Operation Transactions**: Batch multiple operations atomically
- **Shared Namespace**: Full compatibility with existing DRC-20 deployments
- **Community Driven**: Evolve through DOP (Dogecoin Operation Proposals)

> *Much protocol. Very universal. Such innovation. Wow.*

## 1. Fundamental Concepts

The DRC-20 Universal Protocol achieves token functionality through explicit, lean transaction structures interpreted by the **Doge Indexer**.

### Transaction Structure

A Universal DRC-20 transaction consists of:

1. **Inputs (UTXOs)**: Standard Dogecoin UTXOs providing DOGE for network fees
2. **OP_RETURN Output(s)**: Contains DRC-20 operation as compact JSON (≤ 80 bytes)
3. **Recipient Output(s)**: Standard Dogecoin outputs (P2PKH, P2SH) receiving tokens
4. **Change Output**: Returns remaining DOGE to sender

### The Account-Based Model: Maximum Safety 🛡️

Unlike fragile UTXO-based systems, DRC-20 Universal uses an **account-based model**:

- ✅ **Address-Based Balances**: Tokens tied to your Dogecoin address, not specific UTXOs
- ✅ **Accident-Proof**: Spending DOGE UTXOs won't affect your token balance
- ✅ **Explicit Transfers**: Only valid DRC-20 transfer operations can move tokens
- ✅ **Intuitive & Safe**: Familiar model that prevents costly mistakes

## 2. Operation Specifications

All operations use JSON payloads in OP_RETURN outputs. The Doge Indexer validates structure and enforces protocol rules.

### Deploy 🚀
Register a new DRC-20 token:

```json
{
  "p": "drc-20",
  "op": "deploy", 
  "tick": "DOGE",
  "max": "100000000000",
  "lim": "1000000"
}
```

**Transaction Structure:**
```
Input(s):  Standard DOGE UTXOs (for fees)
Output 0:  OP_RETURN with deploy JSON
Output 1:  Dummy recipient (your address, ≥ dust limit)
Output 2:  Change (optional)
```

### Mint 🏭
Create new token units:

```json
{
  "p": "drc-20",
  "op": "mint",
  "tick": "DOGE", 
  "amt": "1000000"
}
```

**Transaction Structure:**
```
Input(s):  Standard DOGE UTXOs (for fees)
Output 0:  OP_RETURN with mint JSON  
Output 1:  Token recipient address
Output 2:  Change (optional)
```

### Transfer 💸
Move tokens between addresses:

```json
{
  "p": "drc-20",
  "op": "transfer",
  "tick": "DOGE",
  "amt": "500000"
}
```

**Transaction Structure:**
```
Input(s):  Sender's DOGE UTXOs (provides authorization)
Output 0:  OP_RETURN with transfer JSON
Output 1:  Token recipient address  
Output 2:  Change (optional)
```

## 3. Multi-Operation Transactions 🚀

**Coming Soon**: Batch multiple operations in a single atomic transaction!

### Example: Multi-Transfer
Send different tokens to multiple recipients:

```
Input(s):  Sender's UTXOs
Output 0:  OP_RETURN {"p":"drc-20","op":"transfer","tick":"DOGE","amt":"1000"}
Output 1:  Alice's address (receives 1000 DOGE tokens)
Output 2:  OP_RETURN {"p":"drc-20","op":"transfer","tick":"SHIB","amt":"500"}  
Output 3:  Bob's address (receives 500 SHIB tokens)
Output 4:  Change
```

### Example: Atomic Deploy + Mint
Deploy and immediately mint in one transaction:

```
Output 0:  OP_RETURN {"p":"drc-20","op":"deploy","tick":"NEW","max":"1000000"}
Output 1:  OP_RETURN {"p":"drc-20","op":"mint","tick":"NEW","amt":"1000000"}
Output 2:  Treasury address (receives all tokens)
Output 3:  Change
```

## 4. Dogecoin Operation Proposals (DOPs)

The DRC-20 Universal Protocol evolves through community-driven **Dogecoin Operation Proposals (DOPs)**:

### DOP Process
1. **Draft**: Fork repository, write proposal using template
2. **Submit**: Create pull request with detailed specification  
3. **Review**: Community discussion and technical review
4. **Ratification**: Consensus reached, DOP approved and numbered
5. **Implementation**: Integrated into Doge Indexer consensus rules

### DOP-000: much_return 
Migration bridge from legacy DRC-20 standards to Universal Protocol.

*Specification coming soon...*

## 5. Consensus Rules

The Doge Indexer **MUST** enforce these rules:

✅ **Operation Binding**: Each OP_RETURN binds to the immediately following non-OP_RETURN output  
✅ **Valid JSON**: Payload must be valid JSON starting with `{"p":"drc-20"`  
✅ **Size Limit**: JSON payload ≤ 80 bytes (OP_RETURN limit)  
✅ **Unique Tickers**: Deploy valid only if ticker unused in any DRC-20 standard  
✅ **Token Existence**: Mint/transfer must reference validly deployed ticker  
✅ **Supply Limits**: Respect max supply and per-mint limits  
✅ **Sufficient Balance**: Transfers require adequate sender balance  
✅ **Dust Compliance**: All recipient outputs must meet dust threshold  

## 6. Security Considerations ⚠️

### Critical Considerations
- **Indexer Dependence**: Protocol state depends on consistent indexer implementations
- **Output Ordering**: Incorrect output sequence = tokens sent to wrong address  
- **Irreversible Operations**: All confirmed operations are final
- **Private Key Security**: Standard Dogecoin private key best practices apply

### Safety Features
- **Account-Based Model**: Cannot accidentally burn tokens by spending UTXOs
- **Explicit Operations**: Only valid DRC-20 transfers can move tokens
- **Address Control**: Control private keys = control tokens

## 7. Best Practices 🌟

### For Users
- ✅ **Validate Transactions**: Always verify OP_RETURN payload and output order before signing
- ✅ **Use Trusted Tools**: Only use audited wallet software for DRC-20 operations  
- ✅ **Test Small Amounts**: Test with small amounts before large transfers
- ✅ **Backup Keys**: Standard Dogecoin key management practices

### For Developers  
- ✅ **Batch Operations**: Use multi-operation transactions to reduce fees
- ✅ **Minimize Payload**: Use short keys (`m`, `l`) and concise tickers
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Rigorously validate all user inputs
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Handle indexer responses gracefully

### For Infrastructure
- ✅ **Run Indexer**: Operate your own Doge Indexer for maximum reliability
- ✅ **Monitor Consensus**: Track indexer consensus across implementations
- ✅ **Backup Data**: Regular indexer state backups essential
